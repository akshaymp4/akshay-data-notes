# 1️⃣ Introduction

📘 **What is Databricks?**

Databricks is a cloud-based unified data and AI platform built on top of Apache Spark that enables organizations to process, analyze, and build machine learning solutions on large-scale data.

It is designed around the Lakehouse architecture, which combines:

Data Lake capabilities → Low-cost storage, flexibility, support for structured and unstructured data

Data Warehouse capabilities → High performance, ACID transactions, governance, and BI optimization

This means Databricks gives you the flexibility of a data lake and the reliability of a data warehouse in a single platform.

🚀 **Why Databricks is Called a Managed Service**

Databricks is a managed service, meaning you do not need to manually set up or maintain infrastructure.

Instead of configuring servers, installing Spark, handling failures, and tuning performance — Databricks manages these for you automatically.

**It takes care of:**

Cluster management
Infrastructure provisioning
Scaling
Performance optimization
Security integrations

**This allows**:

Data Engineers → to focus on pipelines

Analysts → to focus on insights

Data Scientists → to focus on models

Instead of spending time on DevOps or infrastructure setup.

1️⃣ Cluster Management

Cluster management refers to the automatic creation, configuration, monitoring, and termination of compute clusters used to process data.

👉 Databricks automatically manages Spark clusters so users don’t need to manually configure servers.

2️⃣ Infrastructure Provisioning

Infrastructure provisioning is the process of setting up cloud resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.

👉 Databricks automatically provisions the required cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) when you start a cluster.

3️⃣ Scaling

Scaling is the ability to increase or decrease computing resources based on workload demand.

👉 Databricks supports auto-scaling, meaning it can add or remove worker nodes automatically depending on workload size.

4️⃣ Performance Optimization

Performance optimization involves tuning system resources and execution strategies to run workloads faster and more efficiently.

👉 Databricks optimizes Spark jobs automatically using features like query optimization, caching, and optimized execution engines.

5️⃣ Security Integrations

Security integrations ensure that data access and system usage are secure and compliant with organizational policies.

👉 Databricks integrates with cloud IAM systems, role-based access control, encryption, and Unity Catalog for governance.

💡 In Simple Words 

Without Databricks → You manage servers, install Spark, scale manually, secure everything yourself.

With Databricks → You just write code. The platform manages everything else

This allows data engineers, analysts, and data scientists to focus on building data solutions instead of managing infrastructure.

3️⃣ What is Metadata?

Metadata is “data about data.”

It provides information that describes, explains, or gives context to other data.

Examples of Metadata:

Table name

Column names

Data types

File location

Owner

Created date

Permissions

Metadata helps in:

Data discovery

Governance

Access control

Query optimization

4️⃣ **Managed Tables vs External Tables**

Databricks supports two main types of tables:

🔹 **Managed Tables**

In managed tables, Databricks manages both metadata and physical data storage.

**Characteristics:**

Storage location controlled by Databricks

Dropping table deletes both metadata and data

Strong governance using Unity Catalog

Suitable for fully controlled environments

Multi-tool Access: Difficult

Data Governance: Fully governed

Use Case: Quick analytics, internal BI systems, tightly controlled environments

🔹 **External Tables**

In external tables, Databricks manages only metadata, while data remains in external storage (like S3, ADLS, GCS).

**Characteristics:**

Data stored outside Databricks-managed location

Dropping table removes only metadata

Flexible integration with other tools

Requires governance discipline

Multi-tool Access: Easy

Data Governance: Flexible but requires discipline

Use Case: Shared datasets, existing data lakes, multi-tool ecosystems

### 🔎 Managed vs External Tables

| Feature | Managed Table | External Table |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Metadata Management | Databricks | Databricks |
| Data Storage | Managed by Databricks | Stored externally (S3/ADLS/GCS) |
| Data Deletion | Metadata + Data deleted | Only metadata deleted |
| Multi-tool Access | Limited | Easy |
| Governance | Fully controlled | Flexible |
| Best For | Internal analytics | Shared datasets / Existing data lakes |


5️⃣ Lakehouse Architecture

**Benefits:**

Centralized access control

Fine-grained permissions (row/column level)

Data lineage tracking

Cross-workspace governance

It ensures secure and compliant data usage across the organization.

9️⃣ ACID Principles

Databricks (via Delta Lake) supports ACID properties:

A – Atomicity
A transaction either fully completes or fully fails.

C – Consistency
Data remains valid before and after a transaction.

I – Isolation
Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.

D – Durability
Once committed, data remains stored even if failures occur.

ACID ensures reliability in large-scale data systems.

### 🔒 ACID Properties in Delta Lake

| Property | Meaning | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Atomicity | All or nothing execution | Failed transaction rolls back |
| Consistency | Data remains valid | Constraints enforced |
| Isolation | Transactions do not interfere | Concurrent writes handled safely |
| Durability | Data remains after commit | Data persists after crash |


🔹 OLTP vs OLAP (Very Important for Data Engineers)

OLTP is for running daily business transactions, while OLAP is for analyzing data and generating insights.

Since you're moving towards Data Engineering / Analytics, understanding this clearly is very important.

🟢 What is OLTP?

OLTP = Online Transaction Processing

👉 Used for day-to-day operations
👉 Handles many small transactions

🏦 Example Systems

Amazon (placing an order)

Paytm (making payment)

Bank ATM withdrawal

📌 What Happens in OLTP?

When you:

Add an item to cart

Make payment

Transfer money

Book a ticket

The database:

Inserts data

Updates records

Deletes records

Ensures data consistency

🖼 OLTP Database Structure

![alt text](image-3.png)

✔ Highly normalized tables
✔ Fast inserts & updates
✔ Supports thousands of concurrent users

🔹 Example OLTP Query:

UPDATE orders
SET status = 'Shipped'
WHERE order_id = 101;

Small, fast transaction.

🔵 What is OLAP?

OLAP = Online Analytical Processing

👉 Used for analysis & reporting
👉 Works on large historical data

Used by:

Data Analysts

Data Scientists

Business Intelligence teams

📊 Example Systems

Tableau

Power BI

Snowflake

Databricks

🖼 OLAP Structure (Data Warehouse)

![alt text](image-4.png)      ![alt text](image-5.png)

✔ Star schema

✔ Fact table + Dimension tables

✔ Aggregations

✔ Historical data

🔹 Example OLAP Query

SELECT region, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;

This scans millions of rows.
